# Commit Changes Workflow

Use this workflow to commit changes to the repository.

## Workflow

1. Inspect changes (if you don't already know what has changed):
   - Review staged changes: `git --no-pager diff --staged`.
   - View unstaged changes: `git --no-pager diff`.
   - For a combined view: `git --no-pager diff HEAD`.

2. Follow these format rules for commit messages:
   - Use imperative form (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature").
   - Start with a capital letter (sentence case).
   - Do not end the message with punctuation.
   - Keep the message to a single line.
   - Describe what is changed and the motivation, but keep it concise.

3. Build and test the codebase (unless you just did it):
   - If changes have been made to backend `*.cs`, run:
      ```bash
      [CLI_ALIAS] test --backend
      ```
   - If changes have been made to frontend `*.ts`, run:
      ```bash
      [CLI_ALIAS] check --frontend
      ```
   - If there are errors, they must be fixed before the commit can be made.

4. Format the codebase (unless you just did it):
   - If changes have been made to backend `*.cs`, run:
      ```bash
      [CLI_ALIAS] format --backend
      ```
   - If changes have been made to frontend `*.ts`, run:
      ```bash
      [CLI_ALIAS] format --frontend
      ```

```

### Example 2 - Commit Workflow

```bash
# ✅ DO: Review changes before committing
# Step 1: Review staged changes
git --no-pager diff --staged

# Step 2: Check if there are unstaged changes you want to include
git --no-pager diff

# Step 3: Add all changes if needed
git add -A

# Step 4: Commit with a proper message
git commit -m "Add user profile image upload functionality"

# ❌ DON'T: Commit without reviewing changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix stuff"
```
